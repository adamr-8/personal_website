                <h3>E-Commerce</h3>
                <p>Introduction: Mastering the digital marketplace requires a blend of technical know-how, customer insight, and agile management. My extensive experience in e-commerce spans across major platforms, development roles, and optimization strategies, all aimed at driving significant growth and creating seamless online experiences.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Platform Expertise:</b> Managed e-commerce operations across multiple platforms including Yahoo Small Business, Shopify, WordPress, Wix, and marketplaces such as eBay, Mercari, and Amazon. Leveraged each platformâ€™s strengths to maximize reach and revenue.</li>
                    <li><b>Driving Revenue Growth:</b> At OptiMA Inc., I managed the flagship e-commerce site, MyWhiteboards.com, where I optimized SEO and user experience (UX) to increase sales by 50%. By implementing automated order processing systems, I reduced shipping times by 40%, significantly improving customer satisfaction.</li>
                    <li><b>Front-End and Back-End Development:</b> Led both front-end and back-end development projects, including a complete redesign of MyWhiteboards.com to improve user experience and site performance. Collaborated with and managed third-party developers to ensure that all technical aspects aligned with business goals.</li>
                    <li><b>Platform Migration:</b> Led the seamless migration of e-commerce platforms, ensuring minimal downtime and maintaining a consistent user experience. This involved coordinating with cross-functional teams and third-party developers to ensure all aspects of the transition were handled smoothly.</li>
                    <li><b>Building from the Ground Up:</b> As a co-founder of Goat Trading LLC, I launched a niche e-commerce platform on Shopify that catered to a passionate community of collectors. Through targeted digital marketing strategies and platform optimization, I drove a 30% increase in sales within the first year, establishing a loyal customer base and a strong online presence.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One of the key projects at OptiMA involved overhauling the SEO strategy for MyWhiteboards.com. By conducting in-depth keyword research and optimizing on-page elements, I was able to boost organic traffic by 25%. This not only increased sales but also positioned the company as a leading name in the dry erase board market. The project also included managing a team of third-party developers to implement these changes seamlessly.</p>
